          The Icehouse was built around 1920 as a storage for ice. The original
          building was only the basement with its 90 cm thick stone walls
          covered by a roof. In 1989 the roof was raised to accommodate a flat
          of about 60 square meters. This flat was totally renovated in 2006.
          All floors are water-heated, the fireplace gives the extra heat needed
          on a freezing winter night. It now contains a bedroom with glass
          doors, bathroom, kitchen in connection with the large open livingroom.
          In the attic there are two beds. A small garden is connected to the
          icehouse - when the weather permits its suitable for eating, grilling
          etc. <br />
