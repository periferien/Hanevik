        The Annex was set up in this location in 1900 with timber from a much
        older building. It was used as a shed for about a century, before we
        turned it into an intimate house for living in the 1990s. Totally
        renovated i 2005 with new kitchen and bathroom.<br />
        The Annex contains living room, kitchen, bedroom on the loft, bathroom.
        The house is small, but practically fitted. There are 2 comfortable beds
        in the loft, and 2 beds on a sleeping coach in the living room. Extra
        matrasses on request. All floors water heated. The Annex has its own
        part of the garden with a nice view to the sea.
