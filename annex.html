          The Annex was set up in this location in 1900 with timber from a much
          older building. It was used as a shed for about a century, before we
          turned it into an intimate house for living in the 1990s. Totally
          renovated i 2005 with new kitchen and bathroom.<br />
          The Annex contains living room, kitchen, bedroom on the loft,
          bathroom. The house is small, but practically fitted. There are 2
          comfortable beds in the loft, and 2 beds on a sleeping coach in the
          living room. Extra matrasses on request. All floors water heated. The
          Annex has its own part of the garden with a nice view to the sea.
